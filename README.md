# Description
This project was created to combine the knowledge of what we learned in express and deploy a functioning note taker application to my heroku site. 

https://github.com/shane-pearson/note-taker


## Usage 

This site can be used by anyone who would like to input a note and have that saved into the deployed site. 

### Installation

To install this site I had to take some pre-made code, adn use that to finish creating the deployed site. I started by creating a server.js file. I then added in the express add ons I needed, along with the middle ware programs. I then made the server.js file speak to the other code that was already built. I then made all this code listen on a port. Finally I deployed the site to heroku. 

#### Credits

I credit the good class material to help me build this site. I also used tutoring services which helped me fine tune some of my code.
